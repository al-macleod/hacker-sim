# Hacker Simulator

This is a minimal browser-based hacker simulation game using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

## Running the game

Open `index.html` in a web browser. The terminal interface supports a few simple commands:

- `help` - list available commands
- `clear` - clear the terminal output
- `mission` - show a sample mission description
- `market` - view items available on the darknet market
- `buy <item>` - purchase an item
- `wallet` - display your credits
- `inbox` - list NPC emails
- `read <n>` - read a specific email
- `npc <message>` - contact an adversary

Feel free to extend the command system and add missions for a deeper simulation experience.
