# Hacker Simulator

This is a minimal browser-based hacker simulation game using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

## Running the game

Open `index.html` in a web browser. The terminal interface supports a few simple commands:

- `help` - list available commands
- `clear` - clear the terminal output
- `mission` - show a sample mission description

Feel free to extend the command system and add missions for a deeper simulation experience.
